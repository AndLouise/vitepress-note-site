## 自我认知

### 你最大的优势是什么 {#advantages}

**我的核心优势是目标驱动与高度责任感**：我一旦确立目标就会全力以赴，对交付的工作必定闭环完成，具备快速学习能力的能力。

> My core strengths are goal driven and a high sense of responsibility: once I establish my goals, I will do my best, and I will definitely complete the delivered work in a closed loop. I also have the ability to learn quickly.

**我最大的优势是负责任和不放弃**，交给我的事情一定会完成，我从小到大一直是这样。

> My biggest advantage is being responsible and never giving up. Whatever is given to me, I will definitely complete it. I have always been like this since I was young.

**我属于严格的目标导向型**，我要做的事情不会迟疑也不会放弃。

> I belong to a strict goal oriented type, and I will not hesitate or give up on what I want to do.

### 你最大的弱点是什么 {#weaknesses}

**我的缺点是做事时候容易有强迫症**，对事情经常反复检查，或者对一些小事一定要放在眼皮底下才放心。对细节的过度关注有时影响了我的工作效率，不过我正在通过制定学习计划来提高效率，现在已能较好平衡质量与速度。

> My weakness is that I tend to have OCD when doing things, and I often double check things or always keep small things under my nose to feel at ease. Excessive attention to details sometimes affects my work efficiency, but I am improving it by developing a study plan and now I am able to balance quality and speed well.

### 如何处理冲突，如何在压力下工作 {#stress-management}

**我认为保持专注是应对压力的关键**。当我进入专注状态时，外界干扰就会自然消失。为了提高效率，我经常使用番茄工作法，通过一段专注时间让我快速进入状态。这种方法能保证我的工作质量。

> I believe that maintaining focus is the key to coping with stress. When I enter a focused state, external interference will naturally disappear. In order to improve efficiency, I often use the tomato working method, which allows me to quickly get into a focused state through a period of time. This method can ensure the quality of my work.

**此外，我还想说"万事开头难"**，很多时候大多数人们学习新东西会怯场——并不是能力上真的学不会，而是学习的自信降低了导致学不会。面对这种情况，我也有自己的学习方法。

> In addition, I also want to say that 'the beginning of everything is difficult'. Many times, most people feel stage fright when learning new things - it's not because they really can't learn, but because their confidence in learning has decreased, leading to their inability to learn. In the face of this situation, I also have my own learning methods.

**第一遍迅速读**，即使看不懂也不要畏难，主要建立初步印象即可。**然后带着记忆看第二遍**。**最后在第三遍学习时**，我大概会有一些自己思考的问题，比如为什么不能那样处理，然后对照答案再去做一遍，基本上自己就会了。

> Read quickly for the first time, even if you don't understand, don't be afraid of difficulties, just establish a preliminary impression. Then watch it again with memories in mind. In the third round of learning, I will probably have some self thinking questions, such as why I cannot handle it that way, and then compare them with the answers to do it again. Basically, I will understand it myself.
